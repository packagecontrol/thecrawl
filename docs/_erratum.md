## Removed
- customizing_packages.md: has little to do with package control itself and the meat of it is also covered in the [community docs](https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/extensibility/packages.html#customizing-or-overriding-packages).

## TODO
- dependencies.md: I know too little about this to properly rewrite it.
